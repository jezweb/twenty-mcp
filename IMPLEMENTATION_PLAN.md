## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- TypeScript strict mode
- Comprehensive type definitions
- JSDoc comments for all public methods
- Follow existing code patterns

### Performance Considerations
- Implement pagination for list operations
- Use GraphQL field selection to minimize data transfer
- Cache metadata queries
- Batch operations where possible

### Security Considerations

- Maintain changelog
- Tag releases in git
- Update MCP SDK dependencies regularly

### Testing Phases
1. Local development testing
2. Integration testing with Twenty sandbox
3. Beta testing with limited users
4. Production release

### Migration Support
- Backward compatibility for existing tools
- Deprecation warnings for changed APIs
- Migration guides for breaking changes

## Success Metrics
- All tools have >95% test coverage
- Response time <500ms for standard operations
- Support for 100+ concurrent operations
- Zero critical bugs in production
- Positive user feedback on new features

## Timeline Summary
- **Week 1-2**: High priority features (Opportunities, Activities)
- **Week 3-4**: Medium priority features (Custom Objects, Webhooks, Metadata)
- **Week 5-6**: Advanced features (Prompts, Bulk Operations)
- **Week 7-8**: Enhanced features and polish

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve implementation plan
2. Set up development environment
3. Create feature branches for each phase
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation
5. Regular progress reviews and adjustments
